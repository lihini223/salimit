## Introduction
This project is a saline level detection and alerting system. Saline is given when patient’s body is dehydrated and the saline level in the given bottle requires constant monitoring. As per the technology is growing Internet of Things (IOT) has become a major in the field. Since IOT connects electronic devices and other embedded items with software over the internet, this project came up as a IOT solution for the requirement of the constant saline level monitoring.
In this project, a critical saline level is detected, and an alert will be sent to the nurse’s mobile application and to the nurse station. There will be a mobile application to track all the patients who has been given saline and nurse will be able to monitor each patient in the ward. When the system triggers an alert nurse can easily identify which patient’s saline is going to be finished. Also, nurse can set a timer for patients who need continuous attention after giving the saline. 

## Definition of the problem 
Saline is given when patient’s body is dehydrated and the saline level in the given bottle requires constant monitoring. The saline bottle needs to be replaced/remove immediately when the bottle is fully consumed. Otherwise, Blood rushes outward into the saline because of the pressure differential between the patient's blood pressure and the empty saline container. This kind of situations can lead to harmful threats to patient’s health. 

## Project Objectives 
-	Prevent patient’s blood rushing outwards.
-	Nurse can monitor each patient saline.
-	Nurse can track timing of each saline bottle that has been given to patients. 
-	Nurse can set a timer for the patients who needs continuous attention.
-	Develop a mobile app and a desktop/web app to monitor the live status of patient’s saline given. 

## Devices 
-	Node MCU esp8266
-	IR sensors 
-	RFID sensors
